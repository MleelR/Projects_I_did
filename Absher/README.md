# TrafficLightUsingAI

# Traffic Light Using AI (ABSHERTHON):
------------
## Idea:

Solve the problem of traffic jam in traffic light by using AI and computer vision
to give each traffic light the right time, facilitate the passage of emergency
vehicles by detect it then open the light and detect issues.

------------
## Essential Elements:

- Vehicles count by frame.
- Count vehicles in and out.
- Detect emergency Vehicles.

------------
## Features:

- Can predict the proper time for each traffic light in intersection.
- Can predict the issues happen in in/out range.
- Facilitate the passage of emergency vehicles.
